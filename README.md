# Lane-Dane – Contact & Transaction Management App

## Overview

**Lane-Dane** is a **Flutter-based financial management application** that allows users to **manage personal transactions and contacts efficiently**. The app is designed to provide a **seamless, fast, and offline-capable** experience using **ObjectBox** as the local database. Built with a **clean and structured architecture** following **GetX state management**, Lane-Dane ensures optimal performance and ease of use.

This application serves as a **personal finance tracker**, enabling users to **record transactions** with their contacts, **categorize payments**, and **monitor outstanding dues**. With a focus on user experience, it integrates **search and filtering**, **transaction details tracking**, and a **simple, intuitive UI**.
